  # ----------------------------- Constants and Macros ----------------------------------

  #. Ordering is important. Group and order models as below.

  #. Whitelist all mass-assignable attributes, ordered alphabetically
  #. List all protected attributes immediately after.
  #. Don't list attributes that exist in the db but should not be used
  #. (e.g. STI columns that don't apply to this model).

                  :birthday,

  #. Use the "validates" form over "validates_[uniqueness]_of".

  #. Use "must" to designate validation callbacks (e.g. "name_must_be_german")

  #. Prefer memoize over ||= to memoize.
